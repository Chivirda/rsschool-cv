liked to work with user interfaces.

I've skills in C#, Java, JavaScript. My basic control version system is a GIT. I worked in VS Code,
WebStorm and Visual Studio.
### 5. Code examples: 
Some Kata from codewars :heavy_check_mark:
```javascript
function even_or_odd(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd'
}
```
### 6. Experience: 
I have experience in Vue, React and vanilla JS. For example, my last [Vue project](https://github.com/Chivirda/vue-frontend).
This project is a test for Frontend developer vacancy in my city. But I no have time to finish this.
### 7. Education:
My latest finished course [Frontend in e-commerce](https://study.oneway.su/upload/certificate/frontend-21.pdf).

### 8. English skills:
I learn English from 2014. But my experience has only reading and a bit of writing. Since I teach it on my own.
Basically in mobile apps like Duolingo and Lingualeo. In Duolingo I liked his motivation system.
Which based on non-stop learning. But Lingualeo has more exercises.
